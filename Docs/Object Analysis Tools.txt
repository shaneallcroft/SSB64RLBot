How to use the Object Analysis Tools

These tools allow you to list and examine details about the currently loaded objects.
This guide was originally written for DK64, but the keybinds apply to several games.

"List" shows all currently loaded objects from that model
"Examine" shows all known details about the currently selected object

Keyboard shortcuts:

c = Cycle mode
v = Grab an object (only works when examining/listing object model 1)
b = Focus the camera on an object (only works when examining/listing object model 1)
n = Previous object
m = Next object
z = Zip to selected object, works with both model 1 and model 2

Model 1 contains Actors, for example:
	- Player
	- Camera
	- Enemies, Bosses, and NPC's
	- Blueprints & Kasplats
	- Boss keys (except Key 8)
	- Banana Fairies
	- Bonus Barrels
	- K. Rool Barrels
	- Tag Barrels
	- Kong specific barrels & crates
	- Objects you can carry
		- Boulders
		- Barrels
		- Kegs
	- Cannons & Vines
	- Rainbow coin pads
	- Cutscene and Bonus Barrel controllers
	- Text Boxes
	- Loading zone controller
	- Fake Kongs (caged, DK Rap, test room, cutscenes)
	- Balloons

Model 2 contains lighter weight objects, for example:
	- Gold Bananas
	- Colored Bananas (singles & bunches)
	- Key 8
	- Banana coins
	- Ammo crates
	- Crystal coconuts
	- Bananaporters
	- Instrument pads
	- Kong Specific Pads
	- Bullet switches
	- Simian Slam switches
	- Gorilla Grab levers

Even on maps with no Model 2 objects loaded, eg. main menu, the game still allocates the object model 2 array with a minimum capacity of 450 objects or 0x90 * 450 or 0xFD20
Larger maps, eg. Japes, have object model 2 array sizes over 450

It is currently unknown where the following objects are stored:
- Butterflies
- Fish
- etc etc

Butterflies use standard bone arrays to render

Model 3 documentation
Training grounds there is an object of size 0x60 (0x433A00, may change) containing:
	- Group Type (0x00)
		- 0x02 = Fish
		- 0x03 = Butterflies
	- Number of members (0x02)
	- Unknown Pointer (0x04)
	- Pointer to bone array (0x08)

Stuff you can toggle with the lua console:

encircle_enabled (boolean) - Circles objects from the currently selected object model around the player, warning: crashy & laggy
rat_enabled (boolean) - Sets the animation timers for the player randomly
hide_non_scripted (boolean) - Hides model 2 objects without special behavior scripts

I'll probably add UI for this stuff in the future.
